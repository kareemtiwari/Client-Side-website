	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<h2>First  A litle about myself.I am 21 years old and some things  that i like to do are listen to music, play  basketball, and play videogames. I also like to hang out and watch movies as well. To be a little bit more specific I Really like Horor movies but since no one htat i am around everyday likes them i dont get to watch them often.
		Some of the videogames that I like to play are  under a genre called First-Person Shooters also known as FPS games. The one that I spend  mpst of my time playing currently is called Rainbow Six  Seige.
		The next thing I love  is music, I  have played instruments since i was 12 years old. Since now i dont have  nearly as much time tp play instruments I listen to musci almost everyday. I currently listen to rap musci th emost but i really can listen to any music. I really like Reggea/Soca music, along with country music ,Pop/R&B, as well as rap music.
		Finally, Although I havent played basketball as much as i would have liked to this year, I still like to go regularly. And even though i have hurt myself twice  playing basketball I dont have  any plans of stopping playing.
