		Welcome to my Family!

	<h2>
		A little about my familiy.
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		In my family I have one younger sister and one older brother. My family is from a place in South America called Guyana. My parents moved here when my brother was around 3 years old. I was the first one in my family born here in the US.
		
	With Guyana being a third world country their focus and view of education is so high that our parents push that nothing is more important than education. Below are some pictures of me and my family.
